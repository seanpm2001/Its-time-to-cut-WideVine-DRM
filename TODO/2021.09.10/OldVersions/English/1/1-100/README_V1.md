# Update plans

## From 2021 September 10th

I did some more research today, and found several flaws, and many things that needed to be mentioned. Here are some of my notes from 45+ minutes of research:

### Additions to the WideVine article

Modernization

WideVine costs money monthly to implement, making only the wealthy able to survive in software

Blocks the use of screen recorders and screenshots (Oh BuT ThAtS pIrAcY) do you not see your freedoms getting taken away?

"Securty" levels

L1 variant

L2 variant

L3 variant

HBO Max Linux block

Netflix problem, 480p = max resolution

Why DRM is not needed {

Easily crackable, it isn't actually "secure", there are already hundreds of legitimate downloading tools that can bypass WideVine

It claims to be a security thing, when in fact, it is an insecurity

Bad for the environment

Bad for the user

Bad for the world

Bad for the developer

}

Asserts Googles dominance with Chrome, as it doesn't work on many other browsers they disagree with (Brave, etc.)

"check to make sure you are using an official version of Chrome" translates to "check to make sure you are obeying Google and no-one else, fuck web standards, amiright" /s

Context: HBO increases usage of DRM and attempts to lock out millions of Linux users from using their service.

Tip: Don't, just don't.

Possibly bad (not a trusted source, but it contains interesting info that is true or false, I just can't back it up yet)

https://poorrichardsnews.com/why-does-bmw-usa-on-their-website-use-googles-widevine-to-spy-on-you/

TL;DR: BMW (car manufacturer) supposedly uses DRM on their site to track who watches stuff, and prevents people from interacting with their content.
