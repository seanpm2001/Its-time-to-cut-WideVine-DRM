### [Feature request] Other document formats for this article

I feel that alongside the Markdown option, there should be different formats for this article to be read in, such as:

- [ ] HTML document (*.htm)
- [ ] OpenDocument Text (.odt)
- [ ] Rich Text Format (.rtf)
- [ ] Uniform Office Format (.uot)
- [ ] Portable Document Format (.pdf)
- [ ] Electronic Publication (.epub)
- [ ] Open XML Paper Specification (*.xps)
- [ ] Word 1.0 - 2003 document (*.doc)
- [ ] Word 2007-2022/365 document (*.docx)
- [ ] Plain Text format (*.txt)
- [ ] Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

**11 formats listed**

I also had this idea on 2021 December 28th, but didn't feel like posting it until today (2022, January 1st)

Contributors are welcome to try and make a document version of this article (the latest version of the article first, older versions aren't required, and are not necessary)
