### [Feature request] audio version of this article

I feel that there should be an audio version of this article, even if it is just text to speech.

**Preferred format:** `.ogg or .oga (required)` `.mp3 (secondary)`

**Size limit:** `25 MiB (26,214,400 bytes or 26.21 MB)` (GitHub's rule, not mine)

**Language:** `English (required)` `Esperanto (secondary)` `Any other common language with at least 1 Million speakers (third, fourth, etc.)`

Due to size limits, the audio version may need to be split into multiple files.

I had this idea on 2021 December 28th, but didn't feel like posting it until today (2022, January 1st)

Contributors are welcome to try and make an audio version of this article (the latest version of the article first, older versions aren't required, and are not necessary)
