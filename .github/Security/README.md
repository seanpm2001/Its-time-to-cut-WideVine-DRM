# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is still in its early stages, and security shouldn't be a problem, as it isn't much of a program, rather than an information set.

## Version history

| Version | Supported          | Support status |
| ------- | ------------------ |-----------------|
| 2021.09.09   | :x: | Old version, not supported |
| 2021.12.28   | :heavy_check_mark: | Current version, supported |
| < 2021 December 27th & > 2021.12.28   | :heavy_check_mark:                | Current version set, supported |
| 2021.01.31    | :question: | NOT YET RELEASED |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

Other security currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, @ me privately on GitHub. [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)
