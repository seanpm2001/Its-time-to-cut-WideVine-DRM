# It is time to cut Widevine (Google DRM)

![/WideVine_Logo.jpeg/ failed to load. The image may be corrupt or may have been moved.](/WideVine_Logo.jpeg)

This is an article on why you should stop using Google WideVine (DRM) and uninstall it. DRM needs to be removed. This article will help you make your choice (if you haven't already) WideVine is highly anti-competitive, and extremely restrictive, and is destroying the freedom of videos on the Internet.

Let's cut the WideVine and embrace an open Internet.

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Its-time-to-cut0WideVine-DRM/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 23rd 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## Overview

For other information about why DRM is a problem, [click/tap here](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/)

A general description of DRM: <!-- I worked on making this as easy as possible to read for non-tech savvy people !-->

DRM is a restrictive form of software that prevents you from being able to freely access digital works. In short, when you use DRM, you don't own what you are using, the computer uses you. DRM can be malicious and highly anti-competitive, and it is bad for the environment and your devcies battery life and lifespan due to excessive use of the CPU (processor) and GPU (Graphics card) for example, it can make it so an eBook you download isn't owned by you, and the seller can modify the book or delete it without your permission, as you don't own that book. [Source 1](https://www.quora.com/Can-Amazon-delete-books-on-my-Kindle?share=1) [Source 2](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/amazon_deletes_1984_from) [Source 3](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106989048) [Source 4](https://mashable.com/2009/07/17/amazon-kindle-1984/) [Source 5](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html)

WideVine is the most common video DRM, which restricts your access to videos on a website (such as Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, etc.) it is completely unnecessary, and can lock you out of a service (for example, many streaming services don't work on browsers other than Google Chrome (not even browsers based on Google Chromium, the source code for Chrome, can access these sites) due to Googles DRM monopoly) [see below for more info](#Anti-competitive).

***

## Anti-competitive

WideVine is a DRM that has to be licensed to be used with a browser. Google is extremely slow on reviewing and accepting people, and often refuses people to use it in their products with no reasoning. [Source 1](https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/google-widevine-blocked-my-browser/) [Source 2 (the email thread that went on for over 4 months and resulted in nothing but disappointment)](https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/widevine/gmail-thread.html)

Google has made it much harder for browsers like Brave or Firefox to compete with its pushing of this piece of DRM. Even just using the Electron framework itself will prevent WideVine from working (so you can't visit sites like Netflix, Hulu, etc.) [Source 3](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/10449) [Source 4](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12427)

***

## Lack of freedom

WideVine is used to prevent users from interacting with video on websites. It is a form of digital restrictions managements that prevents you from downloading the video, viewing the video offline, or even taking a screenshot. It is proprietary software and due to its issues with privacy, it is not installed by default on most Linux distributions. It is limiting the freedoms of the web due to its use by Netflix, Disney, and YouTube movies. Your access to the content can be taken away at any time for no reason.

***

## Memory usage

WideVine is bad on memory. Compared to just normally viewing a video without DRM, WideVine will use heavy amounts of CPU and RAM. It is bad on battery life, and it gives no benefits from standard HTML5 video playback.

Privacy is not a thing with WideVine. Proprietary software is designed so that you can't see what is going on at all. With Googles history, it is highly likely that WideVine is an additional piece of software that is spying on you, reading your documents, and other bad things.

If you think you have nothing to hide, **you are absolutely wrong**. This argument has been debunked many times over:

[Via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument#Criticism)

1. Edward Snowden remarked "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. "When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’ You’re saying, ‘I don’t have this right, because I’ve got to the point where I have to justify it.’ The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights."

2. Daniel J. Solove stated in an article for The Chronicle of Higher Education that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors. Solove wrote "When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government data collection and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say."

3. Adam D. Moore, author of Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations, argued, "it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security." He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, sexuality, and religion.

4. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing Cardinal Richelieu's statement "If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or blackmail that individual. Schneier also argued "Too many wrongly characterize the debate as 'security versus privacy.' The real choice is liberty versus control."

5. Harvey A. Silverglate estimated that the common person, on average, unknowingly commits three felonies a day in the US.

6. Emilio Mordini, philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the "nothing to hide" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have "something to hide" in order to hide "something". What is hidden is not necessarily relevant, claims Mordini. Instead, he argues an intimate area which can be both hidden and access-restricted is necessary since, psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.

7. Julian Assange stated "There is no killer answer yet. Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth."

8. Ignacio Cofone, law professor, argues that the argument is mistaken in its own terms because, whenever people disclose relevant information to others, they also disclose irrelevant information. This irrelevant information has privacy costs and can lead to other harms, such as discrimination.

# Alternative methods

Media should not be restricted, online or offline. If people wanted to watch the video without the DRM, they will always find a way to do it. Every piece of software can be cracked. 

[modified excerpt from Wikipedia] Valve president Gabe Newell has stated "most DRM strategies are just dumb" because they only decrease the value of a game in the consumer's eyes. Newell suggests that the goal should instead be "[creating] greater value for customers through service value". Note that Valve operates Steam, a service which serves as an online store for PC games, as well as a social networking service and a DRM platform

This point isn't valid just for video games, it can be applied to anything on a computer. Your computer shouldn't be in complete control of a crazy company that uses bad Artificial Intelligence to delete its users and their work (YouTube, etc.) and has such a bad record. Your computer shouldn't be restricted because a company refuses to share like a badly behaved child. Your computer should be owned by you, and no-one else. You should get rid of DRM altogether, as the content is not worth giving up control of your computer for. These companies have hundreds of billions of dollars. If they do something stupid like this, you should protest it. You could even just download the video elsewhere and view it, as they should be losing money for doing stupid things like this. Copyright infringement isn't a bad thing. People who can't afford movies will download them elsewhere, it has been happening since the start of the global Internet and with the invention of the VHS tape. It hardly affects their revenue, as they wouldn't be able to get that money anyway. DRM is defective by design.

***

## What you can do to help

You can protest DRM. It may seem insignificant, but the more people who go against it, the more that is being done about it.

If you are on Linux and using Firefox, make sure that DRM isn't installed (it normally isn't by default) and don't bother installing it. 

If you are on Windows or MacOS, you may have a much harder time, as DRM is installed by default on these systems, and may auto-reinstall.

Try to avoid the following sites:

[Hulu](https://hulu.com)

[Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/)

[Paramount+](https://www.paramountplus.com/)

[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)

Basically, almost any online video streaming service should be avoided, as the majority of them use DRM and you can't use the site without losing your freedom. It isn't worth it. Send the [MPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association) a message and stop streaming these shows.

You should also avoid any "free with ads" options on the following sites (as this method requires DRM)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

You can also protest DRM with a message on your projects `README.md` file. Here is what I use:

```markdown

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
