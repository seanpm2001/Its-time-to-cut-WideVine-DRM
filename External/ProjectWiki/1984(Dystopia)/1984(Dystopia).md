In Nineteen Eighty Four, the world is split into 3 territories, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Citizens of Oceania are constantly monitored by the leader of Oceania, who is commonly known as Big Brother, and is always watching. Every daily activity is controlled by the regime, and knowledge that is critical of the Ingsoc party is taken and destroyed. All history of the person who created it is erased from the memory of everybody.

_Big brother is watching you._

Every person in Oceania has a government mandated session, known as the 2 minutes of hate, where they are gathered in a room, and are shown atrocities of Eurasia and Eastasia, and the citizens are required to be hateful for 2 minutes out of their days.

Love is forbidden in the regime. The storys protagonist Winston Smith secretly defies the government and keeps a diary hidden behind a brick in his apartment. He has to hide from his Telescreen and write entries. He later sneaks out into the forbidden zone with a loved one.

The thought police are prominent in Nineteen Eighty Four and are tasked with controlling what people think. Newspeak is the language of the top government, and knowledge is altered, so that terms like `2+2=5` are created.
