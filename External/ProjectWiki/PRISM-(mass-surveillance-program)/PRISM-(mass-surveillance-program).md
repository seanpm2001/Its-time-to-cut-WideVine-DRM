The PRISM program is a mass surveillance program by the United States government (Notably the NSA, but the CIA and FBI are also involved) that was leaked in 2013 to the public by Edward Snowden, a true American hero. The activities the government have been performing are extremely dangerous and threaten all elements of life, yet the efforts continue to be defended.

Companies have to pay $20,000,000 (20 million dollars) a year to be part of the program, totaling to $200,000,000 (200 million dollars) every 10 years) the following companies are known to be part of the PRISM program:

## 2013 leak

In 2013, Edward Snowden leaked several documents to let the public know about the atrocities the government was committing. This one in question is the PRISM program. Legally, it was wrong to do this, but morally, it was a big must have, as people needed to know what was happening. This doesn't make Snowden Anti-American, it makes him an American Hero for showing the bad things the government was doing. If people didn't know, it could have gotten much much worse, and gotten completely out of control.
