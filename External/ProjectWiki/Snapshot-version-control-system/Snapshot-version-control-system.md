# Snapshots (version control)

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogle-your-life//wiki/)

_Snapshots are part of an old version control system I have been using since early 2019 in my projects. A snapshot is an archived version of a page for after edits are done for the day, or a specified time period. Snapshot files do not carry their own extensions, it normally involves **snapshot#** before the file extension in the file path. The use of the word **snapshot** was inspired by VirtualBox Virtual Machine snapshots_

_Different file types use different aliases. Snapshot files are normally always HTML files. Everything else uses a different system for archival (which is V# (as in V1) at the end of the file)_

_Snapshot files are not to be modified after they are created. They are an archival of the work from a day, and not a continuing project._

_In the bottom of HTML documents, a snapshot section is normally included. This snapshot section links to all the snapshots of a page, and (in later documents) shows the date of the snapshot in the snapshot section._
