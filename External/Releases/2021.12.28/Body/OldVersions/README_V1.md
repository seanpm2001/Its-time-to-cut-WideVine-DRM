# 2021 End of year release

## 2021.12.28

### About

This is the end of year release for this article project. I have made a significant amount of progress on my DeGoogle project this year, and I am now wrapping up this project for the year. There is less than 77 hours left in the year, so I doubt I will need to do anything to this project in that time.

This particular DeGoogle article became my most popular project of 2021, with 24 stars, 6 watchers, and 16 forks. I kind of hoped that a software project would have been the most popular, but I am still grateful for this milestone, and all the community support.

This release archives data up to 2021 December 28th. A goal for next year should probably be making a Wiki.
