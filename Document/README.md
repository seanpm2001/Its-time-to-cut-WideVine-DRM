# Read a compiled/portable version of this article

To make this project more accessible, publications in formats other than markdown has been requested. Currently, the following formats are planned to be supported:

- [ ] DOC

- [ ] DOCX

- [ ] EPUB

- [ ] HTML

- [ ] Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB)

- [ ] ODT

- [ ] PDF

- [ ] RTF

- [ ] TXT

- [ ] UOT

- [ ] XPS 

Contributors can help make a publication by copying the source, and fixing the formatting, so that it reads the same in the portable format as the markdown format (exceptions include a TXT version, it still has to have the same source text)

This area is coming soon. See more instructions on the [raised issue #13](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM/issues/13/)
