# Device private key

I have checked the traffic for this project today (2022, Thursday, January 6th) and there seems to be a lot of people coming in search of a WideVine CDM key. I am sorry, **this project does not contain any keys.** this project is a set of articles and information regarding WideVine and why it shouldn't be used.

The point is that you should **STOP** using WideVine DRM, not circumvent its usage. I do recognize that weakening the security of WideVine is important, but this project does not and will not ever contain any CDM keys while the malware is functional.

I cannot link to projects directly, but if you still want a key, you can try to search the web for it. Here are some links you can try. Please note I am NOT responsible for anything you do on other peoples projects
