# Listen to an audio version of this article

To make this project more accessible, an audio book version has been requested. Currently, the following formats are planned to be supported:

- [ ] AIFF

- [ ] ALAC

- [ ] FLAC

- [ ] M4A

- [ ] MP3

- [ ] OGA

- [ ] OGG

- [ ] WAV

Contributors can help make an audio book version with text to speech software, or their own voice. If you use T2S/TTS software, please also specify the name of the voice, the pitch, and any other details, so that the voice can be verified.

This area is coming soon. See more instructions on the [raised issue #12](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Its-time-to-cut-WideVine-DRM/issues/12/)
